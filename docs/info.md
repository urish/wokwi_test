## How it works

Using a clock and a binary counter, this design counts from 0 to 6 and then resets back to 0. For every value of the counter, a different letter is displayed on the 7-segment display. The mapping from counter value to letter is as follows:

- 0: O
- 1: 2
- 2: E
- 3: L
- 4: H
- 5: d
- 6: (blank)

## How to test

You can manually test the inputs using the switch:

| SW      | Function        |
|---------|-----------------|
| 1       | Reset           |
| 2       |  a              |
| 3       |  b              |
| 4       |  c              |
| 5       |  N/A            |
| 6       |  N/A            |
| 7       |  N/A            |
| 8       |  N/A            |

Set the clock to 1 Hz and observe the display. You should see the letters O, 2, E, L, H, d, and blank as you increment the counter from 0 to 6.
